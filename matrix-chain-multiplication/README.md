<h1>Matrix Chain Multiplication</h1>
<h5>Finds the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices based on the dimensions.</h5>
<h5>p[] denotes the dimensions of the matrices.</h5> 
<h5>That is, p[0],p[1] would be the dimensions of matrix M0, p[1],p[2] would be the dimensions of matrix M1, and so on.</h5>
